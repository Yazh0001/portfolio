        <div>Background</div>
        <div>At 16, I moved out of Sudan to pursue a degree in Computer Science
            from Monash University. In all honesty, I had close to no interest
            in programming prior, I simply knew I had a passion for analytical
            thinking and abstract problem solving. During this degree is when I found
            my love for computer science.
        </div>
        <div>After graduating, I sought to further my knowledge of real world
        applications of the concepts I had leanred so I took the AWS certified cloud practitoiner certificate.
        </div>
        <div>I followed that up by completeing the Google Data Analytics certificate.</div>
